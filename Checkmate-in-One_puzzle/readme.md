# Checkmate-in-One Puzzle

This project is not yet completed, I am currently working on completing it.

This project showcases my familiarity with the use of classes, objects, constructors, destructors, dynamic memory and the use of operator overloading.

## Overview

For this assignment I will be implementing a variation of the popular chess puzzle, the Checkmate-in_one puzzle. The game takes place on a standard 8 by 8 chess board with a pre-existing setup for both sides and of all the pieces.

The puzzle with a single player getting to make one move in the game. The goal is to checkmate the opponent with the single move and thus end the game.

This variation has a number of important deviations from the standard formulation of the puzzle:
1. The opposing player, the player who does not move first, can only move their king.
2. The opposing king, the one being subject to the potential checkmate, cannot take any enemy pieces.
3. No opposing piece can be used to block an attempt at a checkmate.
4. No pieces will be captured during play.
5. The use of castling, en passant capture or promotion of pawns is not allowed.

Given the two sides, white and black, and white being the one trying to checkmate black, the opposing player in this example will be black. If black were the side to attempt to checkmate white, then white would be the opposing player. 

In this project I will be implementing a program that enables the solving of this kind of puzzle.

## Game Rules

### Game Board

Chess is played on a standardised 8 by 8 board. In real life, chess boards are labelled with a combination of letters and numbers to make the moves easier to interpret by the players and spectators. However for this assignment the chess boards will only referred to by numbers.

For example, consider,
```
01234567
0--------
1--------
2--------
3--------
4--------
5--------
6--------
7--------
```

This is a board made of 8x8 tiles. Each tile represents the open sea and the board is currently completely empty. The positions of the each tile, in terms of coordinates it reflects is given by the numbers. The top leftmost corner is (0,0) and the bottom rightmost corner is (7,7). If compared to a standard chess board such as in Figure 1.

Position (0,0) would correspond to A8 and position (7,7) would correspond to H1. The x coordinate refers to the row and the y coordinate refers to the column. The use of the ````−```` string is used to indicate an empty board space. All spaces not taken up by a piece on the board will be set to this string.

### Pieces

The standard game of chess is played with equal pieces between the players. For the purposes of this project the pieces are referred to on the board by a combination of their colour and their type. For example the string, “bb” would refer to a black bishop whereas “wp” would refer to a white pawn. The full list of types for the pieces is produced below:
- ```p```: pawn
- ```b```: bishop
- ```k```: knight
- ```K```: king
- ```q```: queen

For example, consider a board with two black pawns, a black king, a white king and two
white rooks,

```
wr-------
----wK----
--------
--------
-bpbp----wr
-bK------
--------
--------
```

### Move

For this puzzle, only one side has to submit a move. The move has the following format:

X1,Y1,X2,Y2

The list is delimited by commas and the first two values refers to the x and y coordinates of the piece to be moved and the second set of coordinates refer to its new position.
Note that X refers to the row and Y refers to the column in the matrix. This could be interpreted as chessboard[X1][Y1] for instance.

For the sake of simplicity, white will always be the side to move from bottom to top (i.e. [Y7] to [Y0]), while black will always be the side to move from top to bottom (i.e. [Y0] to [Y7]).

## Classes

### Piece Class

The basis of the project is the ```piece``` class. It is comprised of two files: **piece.h** and **piece.cpp**. A UML diagram for the class is provided to you below:
```
piece
-pieceType:string
-side:char
-xPos:int
-yPos:int
------------------------
+piece()
+piece(newPiece: piece *)
+piece(pType:string, side:char,x:int,y:int)
+∼piece()
+getSide():char
+getPieceType():string
+getX():int
+getY():int
+setX(x:int):void
+setY(y:int):void
+friend operator<<(output:ostream &, t:const piece &):ostream&
+operator[](pos:int):void
+operator+(move:string):piece&
```

#### Member Variables

- ```pieceType```: The string variable indicating what kind of piece it is. The values are as follows:
    - King
    - pawn
    - queen
    - bishop
    - knight
    - rook
- ```xPos```: The X coordinate of the piece on the board.
- ```yPos```: The Y coordinate of the piece on the board.

#### Member Functions

- ```piece```: The default and empty constructor for the piece class. It is blank.
- ```piece(newPiece:piece*)```: This is a copy constructor for the piece class. It receives an instantiated piece object and copies the values of that object into a newly constructed instance.
- ```piece(pType:string,side:char,x:int,y:int)```: This is a value-based constructor for the class. It takes 4 separate arguments which all correspond to values inside the class.
- ```∼piece```: The class destructor. This deallocates any allocated memory of the class. It also prints out (with a new line at the end), the following message: "(X,Y) side type deleted" where side refers to the side of the ship of the piece, type the piece type and the X,Y coordinates where it was found on the board. An example of this output is:
```
(0,0) b rook deleted`
```
The coordinates are printed first, followed by the side and then the piece type.

- ```getSide```: This returns the side char for the piece.
- ```getPieceType```: This returns the type of the piece.
- ```getX```: This returns the X coordinate variable.
- ```getY```: This returns the Y coordinate variable.
- ```setX```: This sets the x coordinate to the passed in value.
- ```setY```: This sets the y coordinate to the passed in value.
- ```operator[](pos:int)```: This is an overload of the [] operator. When called, this will receive an int that takes either the values 0 or 1. If any other value is provided print the message: ”Invalid Index” with a new line at the end. If the index is valid, it should print out one of two messages with a new line at the end. If the value is 0, it should print out the x coordinate and if 1, the y coordinate. The format of the messages are as follows:
```
x coord: 1
y coord: 2
```
The above examples show the output for two different calls of the operator. Only one line of output should be given per call.
- ```operator+(move:string)```: This operator will receive a string with the format
```
x,y
```
where x represents an x coordinate and y represents a y coordinate. If the coordinates are valid (that is within the valid range of the chess board) then the appropriate variables should be set with these variables. If the coordinates are invalid, then nothing should happen.
- ```operator<<```: It also prints out (with a new line at the end), a message in the following format:
```
b rook at [0,0]
```
The side is printed first, then the piece type followed by the coordinates at the end. This message must be sent to the output variable.

### Board Class

It is comprised of two files: **board.h** and **board.cpp**.
A definition for the class is provided below:
```
board
-numWhitePieces:int
-numBlackPieces:int
-whitePieces: piece **
-blackPieces: piece **
-chessboard: string **
-move: string
-sideToMove:char
-operator++():board&
------------------------
+board(pieceList:string)
+∼board()
+operator--():board&
+checkIfPieceHasCheck(pieceType:string ,xPos:int,yPos:int ,kingX:int,kingY:int):bool
```

#### Member Variables

- ```numWhitePieces```:The number of white pieces left on the board.
- ```numBlackPieces```:The number of black pieces left on the board.
- ```whitePieces```: A dynamic array of piece objects representing all of the white piece objects.
- ```blackPieces```: A dynamic array of piece objects representing all of the black piece objects.
- ```chessboard```: A 2D string array representing the chessboard.
- ```move```: The move being submitted as a solution to the given board puzzle.
- ```sideToMove```: The side which is to make the move to solve the puzzle.

#### Member Functions

- ```board(pieceList:string)```: The constructor for the board class. It will receive the game board setup information in the form of a name to the file containing that information. It must read the setup file to extract the required information to instantiate the class variables with appropriate values as defined by the text file format.
    When the constructor has finished executing, the chessboard 2D array should be populated as defined above with the corresponding pieces in their appropriate locations. Additionally, all of the pieces should have their appropriate objects instantiated in their respective arrays.
- ```∼board()```: The destructor for the board object. When called all of the dynamic memory that has been assigned should be deleted. The order (from first ot be deleted to last) of the deletion order is as follows: blackPieces, whitePieces, chessboard. Once deleted, you should print a final message with a new line at the end. The message has the following format:

    ````Num Pieces Removed: X````

    X in this example refers to the total number of pieces (considering both sides) that were originally placed on the board at the start of the program.
- ```operator++()```: This operator moves the piece located at the first set of coordinates to the board position denoted by the second set of coordinates. You can assume that the coordinates will always be correct for the piece and its movement types and that no move will expose a king to being checked. The change in position for said piece should also be reflected in the respective pieces object in the appropriate pieces array for the side that is moving. The coordinates for this move come from the move variable.
- ```checkIfPieceHasCheck(pieceType:string ,xPos:int,yPos:int ,kingX:int,kingY:int)```: This function is used to check if a given piece has a check status on the opposing king. It receives the type of piece being checked for as well as its position (xPos and yPos) and the position of the king to compare against. If the piece has a check then a true is returned otherwise false is returned.
    Note that pawns, queens, knights, bishops and rooks are the only pieces capable of checking a king.
- ```operator−−```: This is the most important operator. It is used to determine if the solution, the move provided, actually solves the Checkmate-in-One puzzle. This operator should, based on the conditions described about the puzzle, determine if the side that made the move induced a checkmate scenario on the opposing player. Remember that the opposing player is only going to be able to move their king, and cannot block checks, or capture pieces that might cause checks. If a checkmate is reached the operator should output the following message with new line at the end:

    ```Success: Checkmate of w King at [X,Y]```

    where X,Y refers to the original coordinates of the opposing king and where they were first put into check. The side of the king that got checkmated should be before the word King. For reference, w refers to the white side and b refers to the black side.

    If the move failed to produce a checkmate, either because it did not check the enemy king, or the enemy king was able to escape, then the message (with a new line at the end) should be:
    
    ```Failed: No Checkmate of w King```
